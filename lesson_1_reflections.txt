How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Sure, sometimes in large project before and after integrate some parts we have the point to back up and ensure this add will not destroy the project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
I'm always forget to save my work! so, i think it is  agood idea to save automatically but from other hand as i saw before it is not very critical in many situation.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think because git manpulate with file as one file insted of google doc which manpulate with each file as spreated file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
1.first we rwite git log to see all commit and q to stop.
2.Use git diff to compare between two version of commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? Becuase it will give me a chance to backward after any mistake.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Of course all my future projects, although that I'm afriad to use it but i will go further and enjoy in the journay.
